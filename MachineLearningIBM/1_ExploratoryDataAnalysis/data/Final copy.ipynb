Simply copy the above code and replace 'px.colors.diverging.Tropic', with any other color scales. For example, the sequential color scales are appropriate for most continuous data, but in some cases it can be helpful to use a diverging or cyclical color scale. Diverging color scales are appropriate for the continuous data that has a natural midpoint.

Generally, feature engineering often follows a sort of [_Pareto principle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), where a large bulk of the predictive gains can be reached through adding a set of intuitive, strong features like polynomial transforms and interactions. Directly incorporating additional information like categorical variables can also be very helpful. Beyond this point, additional feature engineering can provide significant, but potentially diminishing returns. Whether it's worth it depends on the use case for the model. "
